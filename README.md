# Controlify Wynn

> Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play Wynncraft with a controller?

Controllify Wynn aims to make it easy to play Wynncraft with a controller.
It not only adds [Controlify](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify) compatability to [Wynntils](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynntils), but also adds some other nice-to-haves such as additional keybinds (such as a quick Blacksmith sell or Identify) and visual guides (such as the Gathering keybind guide).

## Full Feature List

- Controlify/Wynntils compatability:
  - Allow binding Wynntils keybinds with Controlify
  - Enable better Wynntils GUI navigation with controllers
- New keybinds to help with controller usage:
  - Identify/Sell/Scrap Items (inside Identifer/Blacksmith GUI) - GUI Abstract Action 1
  - Page/Scroll Navigation (inside Trade Market/Bank/Ability Tree/Default Quest Book)
- Contoller gathering button guide
